# MultivariateConsensus

The purpose of this project is to give an introduction to two simple minimization algorithms; normalized gradient descent algorithm (NGDA or NGA) and the recursive least squares algorithm (RLS). In addition to demonstrating how these two algorithms work by utilizing Matlab and providing visual outputs via optimization.m, several examples are provided across two demo scripts, located in demo/.

Should the user wish to read an analysis of these algorithms or demonstrations, a PDF can be found in the docs/ directory. Additionally, in the docs/references/ directory, copies of the two papers used to construct the demo scripts are provided. Each reference, A and B, correspond to their respective demoA.m and demoB.m Matlab scripts.

Feel free to clone this repo and experiment with different scenarios yourself!
